# Podcast Reviews Analysis

This project explores a Podcast Reviews dataset from Kaggle, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/podcastreviews/versions/28).

**Project Scope:**
- SQL queries on the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Statistical inference procedures.
- Creation of dashboards and graphs for data visualization.

**Analysis Highlights:**
- 2 million podcast reviews for 100k podcasts.
- Average ratings in 'society-culture' and 'education' categories statistically different.
- Less than 1% of reviews conducted by bots users.
- No category had its average rating altered by more than 0.01 due to bot reviews.

Presence of bot reviews in the dataset is minimal, with negligible impact on category average ratings.
